In Bedrock Edition, the sleeping animation slowly lowers the player into the bed.\n\n* **Villager Interaction:**  A villager is kicked out of its bed if a player tries to sleep there.  In Java Edition, a sleeping villager's hitbox shrinks, and an anvil dropped on it will cause damage and wake the villager. In Bedrock Edition, dropping an anvil on a sleeping villager causes damage but leaves the villager asleep and the anvil on the bed.
